    "> Tasks 1-5 in this assignment involve writing/editing 1-2 functions. As you do each task, you should also test that your function works by calling it and providing a variety of test inputs. When you are done testing and/or are ready to move on to a different task, you should comment out these lines. This will enable you to rerun your entire notebook without having to worry about which cells might be waiting on input. I have noted in each task, which lines to comment out. In the final task, you will write an interactive program that will enable the user to selectively call all the different functions, at which point the individual calls will no longer be needed. \n",

    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Sentiment Analysis is a Big Data problem which seeks to determine the general attitude of a writer given some text they have written. For instance, we would like to have a program that could look at the text “The film was a breath of fresh air” and realize that it was a positive statement while “It made me want to poke out my eye balls” is negative. \n",
    "\n",
    "One algorithm that we can use for this is to assign a numeric value to any given word based on how positive or negative that word is and then score the statement based on the values of the words. But, how do we come up with our word scores in the first place?\n",
    "\n",
    "That’s the problem that we’ll solve in this assignment. You are going to search through a file containing movie reviews from the Rotten Tomatoes website which have both a numeric score as well as text. You’ll use this to learn which words are positive and which are negative. The data file looks like this:\n",
