    "# Assignment 3: A Recommendation System\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment brings together everything you've learned this term to build something that I hope you'll be proud of. It may seem a bit overwhelming at first due to the sheer number of steps, but we've worked hard to break the assignment down into small steps, each of which you should be capable of handling. Tackle them one-by-one, and remember that they won't all be equally challenging. As a general rule, the more tasks you complete the easier the subsequent ones will become because you will develop a stronger understanding of how everything works as a whole. \n",
    "\n",
    "The tasks are grouped in six parts: file management, account management, getting ratings, making a basic recommendation, making a sophisticated recommendation, and putting it all together. \n",
    "\n",
    "Tackling these one by one is a good strategy for managing the overall complexity of the project. For example, we've just covered file management in week 8, so completing that part of the assignment is a reasonable goal, even if you don't completely understand the overarching algorithm yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite its name the final part of the assignment can actually be completed first. All the function definitions are there (they just haven't been defined to do anything useful yet) and contain print statements where their code will eventually go. So the basic interface can be implemented early on (sort of like a bullet point draft in an essay). This part of the assignment is very similar to the final step of assignment 2 so it can be a nice bit to get out of the way early on. \n",

    "## Introduction: Making recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "If you've ever bought a book online, the bookseller's website has probably told you what other books you might like. This is handy for customers, but also very important for business. Netflix once held [a competition](http://www.netflixprize.com/) to find an algorithn that would perform 10% better than their own; the prize was one million dollars. Making good predictions about people's preferences was that important to this company. It is also a very current area of research in machine learning, which is part of the area of computer science called artificial intelligence.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A basic approach\n",
    "So how might we write a program to make recommendations for books? Consider a customer named Rabia. How is it that the program should predict books Rabia might like? The simplest approach would be to make almost the same prediction for every customer. In this case the program would simply calculate the average rating for all the books in the database, sort the books by rating and then from that sorted list, suggest the top 5 books that Rabia hadn't already rated. With this simple approach, the only information used by the prediction algorithm that is unique to Rabia is whether or not she has read a specific book.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A more sophisticated approach\n",
    "We could make a better prediction about what Rabia might like by considering her actual ratings in the past and how these ratings compare to the ratings given by other customers. Consider how you decide on movie recommendations from friends. If a friend tells you about a number of movies that they enjoyed and you also enjoyed them, then when your friend recommends another movie that you have not seen, you will be more likely willing to go see it. On the other hand, if you and a different friend always tend to disagree about movies, you are not likely to go to see a movie this friend recommends.\n",
    "\n",
    "A program can calculate how similar two customers are by treating each of their ratings as a vector and calculating the dot product of these two vectors. That might sound complicated and technical, but hang in with me for a bit. I promise it's more straightforward than it at first might seem. Let's look at an example: \n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we had 3 books in our database and Rabia rated them [5, 3,-5], Bob rated them [5, -3, 5], Suelyn rated them [1, 5,-3], and Kalid rated them [1, 3, 0]. \n",

    "        <td>Really liked it!</td>\n",
    "    </tr>\n",
    "</table>\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that zero is used to represent no rating (i.e., \"I haven't read it\" not \"It was okay\"). This allows books with no rating to simply disappear from the calculation (since zero multiplied with any other number is always zero). If you don't use this then handling unrated books is much more complicated.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Finally, note that while this is really the heart of the assignment, it is quite tricky relative to the other parts. You can still do well on the assignment even if you skip this part. So if you are commpleted overwhelmed with the prospect of implementing this, set it aside for now and work on getting everything else working properly.* \n",
    "\n",
    "### An even more sophisticated approach\n",
    "While the above approach is good, wouldn't it be better to incorporate everyone's ratings, weighted based on how similar they are to you? Considering again how you decide on movie recommendations from friends. If two friends tell you about a movie they enjoyed and you also tend to like the same things, you are more likely to want to go see it than if only one of them liked it. Similarly, you may have a third friend, with whom you have opposing views on movies. Knowing that this friend hated a movie, may make you more likely to want to see it and vice versa. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can incorporate this information by using the similarity scores from our sophisticated approach to create a weighted average rating for all the books in the database (similar to what was done in the basic approach). In this average, the scores from people who are most like you will have more influence on the average (and people who are your polar opposite will also have influence but in the opposite sense). \n",
    "\n",
    "You won't be asked to implement this algorithm, but if you'd like to take it on as an added challenge, please let me know and I'll get you started with additional details. "

Remember that you need real data for the recommendations to make sense and you need a fairly sizeable dataset to work with (aim for around 50 books/movies/etc and upwards of 100 ratings). You should also use the same file structure. For the rated items (books etc.), the ISBN numbers do not need to be actual ISBN numbers so long as each item in your dataset has a unique number and the years can be estimated. Overall, it is recommended that you get your system working with the provided dataset and then swap in your own data to better explore how your algorithm works. \n",
